# Customer-Churn-Rate
This project focuses on analysing a dataset from a telecommunication company to identify features related to customer churn rate. I have used various analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data and create visualisations to support the analysis. The approach aims to provide customer insights and analysis that can help the target audience to make informed decisions related to marketing strategies. By identifying factors influencing customer churn rate, we aim to provide actionable solutions to help business retain their customers and improve their bottom line.
